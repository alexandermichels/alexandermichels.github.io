Alex Michels is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). He obtained his Ph.D. in Informatics in 2025 and M.S. in Geography in 2024, both from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Alex's research focuses on applications of geospatial data science and cyberGIS to address societal challenges.

If you're interested in my work or collaborating, please feel free to reach out! If you want to chat over coffee, we can meet on campus at UIUC or I'm planning to attend these upcoming events in-person:

* June 17-19th, 2025. Chicago, IL, USA. [I-GUIDE Forum 2025: Geospatial AI and Innovation for Sustainability Solutions](https://i-guide.io/forum/forum-2025/forum-2025-call-for-participation/)
