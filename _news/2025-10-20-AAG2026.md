I'm helping to organize a few things for AAG 2026, including the [AAG 2026 Symposium on Spatial AI and Data Science: Frontiers and Applications](https://i-guide.io/aag-2026-symposium-on-spatial-ai-data-science-frontiers-and-applications/), session on Challenges and Opportunities of Spatial Accessibility, and a session on [GeoAI and Deep Learning Symposium: Geosimulation and Its Emerging Directions with AI](https://aag-meetings.secure-platform.com/aag2026/solicitations/93/sessiongallery/24694).
